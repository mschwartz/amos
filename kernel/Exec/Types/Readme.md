# AMOS Types

These are general purpose types (classes, structs) useful for applications and the kernel.

* BAvlTree, base classes to implement AVL trees
* BHashTable, base classes to implement Hash Arrays (string keys)
* BSparseArray, base classes to implement Sparse Arrays

A sparse array is like a hash table, but the keys for the nodes are TInt64 values.  You can think of the array as infinite in size, and not all subscripts are valid.
